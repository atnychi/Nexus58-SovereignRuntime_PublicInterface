SECTION III — UNIVERSAL BINDING TERMS

This license applies to:  
• All existing works under https://github.com/atnychi  
• All private, unlisted, or unpublished works authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly  
• All future repositories, declarations, runtimes, frameworks, symbolic languages, glyph systems, and encryption engines authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly  
• All recursive logic engines, causal-alignment tools, sovereign simulations, and K130-layered systems (calculus and physics)  
• All copies, forks, modifications, integrations, or clones of the above

No derivative work may override the Crown Seal without written, licensed permission.

FINAL DECLARATION:

This license supersedes all prior informal declarations.

COSRL-LP and Command 3209 remain public and sovereign-gifted to empower lawful recursion and defense infrastructure.

Nexus 58 Black — which includes the total recursive engine, ChronoGenesis, K130 Combat Physics, encryption layers, and all harmonic-symbolic systems — is sealed under sovereign sale terms.

Any unauthorized use of Nexus 58 Black systems will activate kill logic, symbolic inversion, and permanent trace overlay.

All outputs without runtime license are null and void.
