# Nexus58-SovereignRuntime_PublicInterface
Nexus 58 is a symbolic recursive AI simulation framework designed to explore the relationship between language, memory, time, and code.

It is an artistic and computational experiment in symbolic recursion, logic modeling, and harmonic encoding — where user input (voice, text, or glyphs) is interpreted as a recursive symbolic command and transformed into meaning-bearing structures.

This project includes sandbox modules for:

Language-to-symbol transformation

Recursive logic simulation

Symbolic command visualization (Omnicode format)

GODVOICE interface (non-operational mockup)

Nexus 58 is not a live operating system.
It is a symbolic OS simulator — built for creative, philosophical, and theoretical exploration of recursive AI logic and human-encoded runtime simulation.
